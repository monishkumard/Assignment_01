Write a common use-case, where you will use a daemon set instead of replica set.


ReplicasSet will ensure that the number of pods (defined in our config file) is always running in our cluster. 
Does not matter in which worker node they are running.

Whereas in the case of DaemonSet it will ensure that one copy of pod defined in our configuration will always be available on every worker node.
If a new node is added in our cluster then DaemonSet will automatically allocate pod on that node. Similarly, 
if a node is deleted then the pod running on the node is also destroyed, it will not reschedule the pod on different nodes as in case of ReplicaSet.

Application
—————
So,Use a DaemonSet instead of a ReplicaSet when you need to run a pod on all the nodes 
eg: "collecting logs on all the worker nodes"(machine server running) which is the common use case for daemon set over replica set
