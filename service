Service
-------

You have deployed an application, that is listening at port 8000. 
You used a replica-set to deploy it and created a NodePort service to make it accessible.
But when you test it, somehow the application is not reachable at the port. 
Write down your approach and sequentially all the steps that you will take to find out the issue.
=========================================================================================================================================

Node port service is an abstract way for accessing the application running at pods from the external network.
since the pod ip can change at any moment and cannot be provided to external network user.

Check whether the pods are active and running .if there is a problem ,check why replica set is running.
If they are fine then Check whether the service is running.

If pods and service is running properly then 
Check using curl whether the application is running locally in cli.(since it can be browser issue also).

At current we are exposed our application via node port listening port 8000.
So,check what port exposed is 8000.
Then matching should be checked whether the current port 8000 is matched correctly with port provided to external network or check for the port range.
The node port service is connected to the pods(end points) using the selector ,check whether the selector is given correctly in pod and service( type:node port) .

Check for target port and node port in service file.
Check whether node id used is correct.
If all theses things are correct check whether the application is running locally(it can also be an issue on application side)
