Deployement
-----------

Suppose you have deployed your application using a deployment controller. Assume the initial number of replicas is one. 
Write the steps needed to update a container's image using deployment, making sure that there is zero downtime.
======================================================================================================================

Scale the replica based on the required load traffic load, say 3 in our case.
After scaling up the replica from 1 to 3.So to achieve zero down time, we can go for "Rolling update statergy".

In this statergy,It can be made sure that there will always be required instances to handle traffic.
Change the image version name in the deployment file.

To achieve minimum instance running, we can configure how to update the image in the deployment yaml file.

In rolling update configuration in yaml file ,configure 3 things, 
———>how much time we have to wait between batches  (minimum seconds ready) =20
———>maximum surge =1
———>maximum unavailable =1
So at every 20 seconds a batch is updated and the pods are always running.

We should be using the load balancer to connect to the end points so that customer can access a common ip and connect to the pods (services running).
Deployment controller takes care of the rolling update in batches at specified time interval,
so that zero down Time is maintained when the deployment s applied using kebectl apply .
